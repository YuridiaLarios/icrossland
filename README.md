8) Time to start changing some code! we will need to set up MongoDB Atlas, Auth0 application, Auth0API, World trading data API.

9) First, open the project in your text editor.

10) In VSCode use **command-p** to quickly search for the file: react-variables.js or use the side menu and manually find the file under client/src/react-variables.js Add this line of code: **http://localhost:3000** this is where the server will run.

11) In VSCode Use **command-p** to quickly search for the file: **.env.example**

12) rename **.env.example** to just **.env** All your important keys, will go into this file which will be ignored before uploading anything to github. 

### MongoDB Atlas SET-UP

13) create a free account with MongoDB Atlas to set up our cloudbase database: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
We will need to copy the generated URI into our .env file as shown in the tutorial. after that in the terminal run 
**node index.js** under icrossland/server to run the server and see the success message about connecting to the database.

### WorldTradingData API SET-UP

14) create a free account with https://www.worldtradingdata.com/ copy your generated api key into the .env file. (free version will only allow you to retrieve 5 stocks instead of 50 like the original app).

### Auth0 APPLICATION SET-UP
15) Create an account with https://auth0.com/ or login with your google account. Follow the tutorial, and copy the corresponding keys into your .env file for the backend server and also into the Auth.js file in the front-end client. Ignore Audience for now, that's to create protected routes in your backend but it needs extra set up with Auth0 API SETUP
